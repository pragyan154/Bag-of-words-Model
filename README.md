# Bag-of-Words Model

The bag-of-words model is a way to represent text data for analysis. It treats each document as a "bag" of its words, ignoring grammar and word order. Each word is counted, and the frequency of each word is used as a feature for analysis.

## Example

Consider the following documents:

1. "The quick brown fox"
2. "Brown fox jumps"
3. "Fox brown fox"

Using the bag-of-words model, these documents would be represented as:

- Document 1: { "the": 1, "quick": 1, "brown": 1, "fox": 1 }
- Document 2: { "brown": 1, "fox": 1, "jumps": 1 }
- Document 3: { "fox": 2, "brown": 1 }

## How It Works

1. Tokenize the text into individual words.
2. Count the frequency of each word in the document.
3. Represent each document as a vector of word frequencies.
4. Use these vectors for tasks like search, classification, or similarity calculations.

This model is simple yet powerful and is used in various natural language processing tasks.
